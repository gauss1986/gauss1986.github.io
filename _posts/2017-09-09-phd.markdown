This post will NOT cover the details of the algorithms I developed in [Prof. Nair](http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~pbn/)'s group. Instead, it will cover what problem is solved, why it is an important problem to solve and how different is the AAPG scheme I developed. Link to a journal article (with detailed formulation and discussions) and code used for numerical studies will be included. 
 
[Differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation): very common type of governing equation for mathematical and physical systems, take the form of Partial Differential Equations ([PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)) or Ordinary Differential Equations ([ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)). In fluid dynamics they may take the form of Navier–Stokes equations, in economics it may be the Black–Scholes equation, etc.

 [Stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic): fancy ways to say random. A stochastic differential equation typically has random excitation and possibly random boundary conditions, initial conditions and/or coefficients. Stochastic differential equations are more realistic modeling of systems: think about the fuselage under air pressure that can only be estimated to a range, or the constantly changing volatility in the Black-Scholes equation. Stochastic differential equations are harder to solve compare to their deterministic counter-parties. My work is to deal with those already-hard-to-solve differential equations, in its more challenging stochastic form. For large systems with millions of degrees-of-freedom, curse-of-dimensionality kicks in and Monte Carlo is too slow to be useful. The AAPG scheme I developed would decouple the original high-dimensional stochastic system into smaller, independent low-dimensional deterministic systems that can be solved in parallel.  

 [Linear differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation): the easier ones (compare to non-linear differential equations) to solve. In fact, one would be happy to handle single degree-of-freedom stochastic non-linear differential equations. Realistic systems with millions of degree-of-freedom are generally considered mission impossible. The AAPG scheme offers the potential to tackle large stochastic non-linear differential equations efficiently.  

Details of the AAPG scheme is best summarized in the following paper:
> **Lin Gao**, Christophe Audouze, Prasanth B. Nair (2015) Anchored analysis of variance Petrov-Galerkin projection schemes for linear stochastic structural dynamics. [Proc. R. Soc. A 471(2182)](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/471/2182/20150023) [PDF](https://gauss1986.github.io/assets/RSPA_LinGao.pdf)

The above paper includes prototype of the AAPG scheme that was built in Matlab. Large scale numerical studies were later conducted in c++. These code can be found here: [Matlab](https://github.com/gauss1986/UQ_matlab), [c++](https://github.com/gauss1986/UQTK).

What is the impact of this research?

- Making stochastic modeling of large dynamic systems feasible.
- No limitation on linearity.
- Promote more accurate and realistic modeling of (large and nonlinear) dynamic systems under uncertainty. In aircraft design, it means more aggressive fuselage design. In quantitative finance, it means finding alpha from a new angle.
