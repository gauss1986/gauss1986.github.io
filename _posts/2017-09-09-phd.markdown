Before we dive into the details on how great is the algorithm I developed in [Prof. Nair](http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~pbn/)'s group to deal with stochastic linear/nonlinear differential equations, let's make sure these terms make sense to you:
 
[Differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation): very common type of governing equation for mathematical and physical systems, take the form of Partial Differential Equations ([PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)) or Ordinary Differential Equations ([ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)). In fluid dynamics they may take the form of Navier–Stokes equations, in economics it may be the Black–Scholes equation, etc.

 [Stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic): fancy ways to say random. A stochastic differential equation typically has random excitation, and possibly has random boundary conditions, initial conditions and/or coefficients. Stochastic differential equations are more realistic modeling of systems: think of the fuselage under air pressure that can only be estimated to a range, or the constantly changing volatility in the Black-Scholes equation. Stochastic differential equations are harder to solve, of course, compare to their deterministic counter-parties. My work is to deal with those already-hard-to-solve differential equations, in its more challenging stochastic form. We are talking about millions of degree-of-freedom here, so typically curse-of-dimensionality kicks in and needless to say, Monte Carlo is too slow to be useful. The AAPG scheme I developed would decouple the original high-dimensional stochastic system into smaller, independent low-dimensional deterministic systems that can be solved in parallel.  

 [Linear differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation): the easier ones (compare to non-linear differential equations) to solve. In fact, one would be happy to handle single degree-of-freedom stochastic non-linear differential equations. Realistic systems with millions of degree-of-freedom would be mission impossible. The AAPG scheme I worked on offers the potential to tackle such stochastic non-linear differential equations efficiently.  

The details of AAPG scheme is best summarized in this paper:

The C++ code used during this rearch is available [here](https://github.com/gauss1986/UQTK).

What is the impact of this research?

- Make stochastic modeling of large dynamic systems feasible
- Non-linear is not (far) more complicated than linear systems
- Both translates to: tackle problems that was not possible before. In aerocraft design, that means more aggressive fuselage design (\$\$\$). In quantitative finance, that means finding alpha from an angle no one else can (\$\$\$\$).
