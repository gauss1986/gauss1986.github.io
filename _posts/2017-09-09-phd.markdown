Before we dive into the details on how great is the algorithm I developed in [Prof. Nair](http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~pbn/)'s group to deal with stochastic linear/nonlinear differential equations, let's make sure these terms make sense to you:
 
[Differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation): very common type of governing equation for mathematical and physical systems, take the form of Partial Differential Equations ([PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)) or Ordinary Differential Equations ([ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)). In fluid dynamics they may take the form of Navier–Stokes equations, in economics it may be the Black–Scholes equation, etc.

 [Stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic): fancy ways to say random. A stochastic differential equation typically has random excitation and possibly random boundary conditions, initial conditions and/or coefficients. Stochastic differential equations are more realistic modeling of systems: think about the fuselage under air pressure that can only be estimated to a range, or the constantly changing volatility in the Black-Scholes equation. Stochastic differential equations are harder to solve compare to their deterministic counter-parties. My work is to deal with those already-hard-to-solve differential equations, in its more challenging stochastic form. For large systems with millions of degrees-of-freedom, curse-of-dimensionality kicks in and Monte Carlo is too slow to be useful. The AAPG scheme I developed would decouple the original high-dimensional stochastic system into smaller, independent low-dimensional deterministic systems that can be solved in parallel.  

 [Linear differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation): the easier ones (compare to non-linear differential equations) to solve. In fact, one would be happy to handle single degree-of-freedom stochastic non-linear differential equations. Realistic systems with millions of degree-of-freedom are generally considered mission impossible. The AAPG scheme offers the potential to tackle large stochastic non-linear differential equations efficiently.  

The details of AAPG scheme is best summarized in this paper:

What is the impact of this research?

- Making stochastic modeling of large dynamic systems feasible
- Not limit to linear systems
- This results in more accurate modeling of dynamic systems, especially when it is large and nonlinear. In aircraft design, it means more aggressive fuselage design. In quantitative finance, it means finding alpha from a new angle.
